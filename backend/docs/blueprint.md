# **App Name**: Apollo247 Clone - Doctor Listing

## Core Features:

- SEO Optimization: Implement off-page SEO for improved search engine visibility for the doctor listing page.

- Secondary color: Light gray (#f5f5f5) for background and card borders.
- Accent: Teal (#00a99d) for active filter states and call-to-action buttons.
- Maintain a clean and responsive layout, similar to Apollo247, with a clear information hierarchy.
- Use clear and recognizable icons for filter options and doctor information.

## Original User Request:
You have to create clone using Next.js(Offpage SEO should be implimented)  but only for the destination page( create Doctor's listing, Filters, Header Only out of this page),  SQL/NOSQL Database, and the data should be served via backend using REST APIs(You can choose your technology to build this backend)

Destination page: https://www.apollo247.com/specialties/general-physician-internal-medicine
You just have to create two APIs at the backend, one is add-doctor, 2nd one is list-doctor-with-filter(use pagination).
And for UI, create the destination page only, and only filters need to be functional, other UI components can be there without business logic(Means no click events on them, but whatever is needed, please do that)
